# EPOS Resources-Service

The **Resources-Service** is a core component of the EPOS Integrated Core Services Central (ICS-C) infrastructure. It provides RESTful APIs to manage, query, and expose metadata records describing digital assets—such as datasets, software, and services—compliant with the EPOS-DCAT-AP model. This service acts as the primary interface for accessing the EPOS Metadata Catalogue, enabling interoperability across the EPOS ecosystem.

## Overview

The Resources-Service is designed to:

* Serve as the authoritative access point for metadata records ingested into the EPOS Metadata Catalogue.
* Provide RESTful APIs for querying and retrieving metadata records.
* Ensure compliance with the EPOS-DCAT-AP model, facilitating interoperability and adherence to FAIR principles.
* Integrate seamlessly with other EPOS services, such as the Ingestor-Service and the EPOS Data Portal.

---

## Key Features

* **Metadata Retrieval**: Access metadata records describing digital assets provided by Thematic Core Services (TCSs).
* **RESTful API**: Expose endpoints for querying metadata based on various criteria.
* **Compliance**: Ensure metadata conforms to the EPOS-DCAT-AP model, an extension of DCAT-AP tailored for the EPOS community.
* **Integration**: Work in conjunction with other EPOS services to provide a cohesive metadata management ecosystem.([Epos EU][1])

---

## Architecture

The Resources-Service is built using a microservices architecture, leveraging Spring Boot for rapid development and deployment. It interacts with a relational database to store and retrieve metadata records. The service is designed to be stateless, ensuring scalability and ease of maintenance.([Epos EU][2])

**Components:**

* **API Layer**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate service components.
* **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic for processing metadata queries and interactions.
* **Persistence Layer**: Manages database interactions, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of metadata records.

---

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

* Java 11 or higher
* Maven 3.6 or higher
* Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/epos-eu/resources-service.git
   cd resources-service
   ```



2. **Build the Application:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```



3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Set the necessary environment variables, such as `BASECONTEXT`, to configure the application's context path.

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   java -jar target/resources-service.jar
   ```



---

## Configuration

The application can be configured using environment variables or application properties. Key configurations include:([Epos EU][1])

* **Database Settings**: Configure the database URL, username, and password.
* **Server Port**: Set the port on which the application will run.
* **Logging**: Adjust logging levels and formats as needed.([PMC][3])

*Note*: Ensure that the database schema is initialized before starting the application.

---

## API Usage

The Resources-Service exposes RESTful endpoints for interacting with metadata records. While specific endpoint details are not provided in the repository, typical operations include:

* **Retrieve Metadata Record**: Fetch a metadata record by its unique identifier.
* **Search Metadata**: Query metadata records based on criteria such as keywords, resource type, or provider.
* **List All Records**: Retrieve a list of all available metadata records.

*Note*: For detailed API specifications, refer to the Swagger documentation if available or inspect the controller classes within the source code.
